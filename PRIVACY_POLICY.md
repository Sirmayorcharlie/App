# Privacy Policy

## TL;DR: We Don't Touch Your Data

This privacy policy exists because Google made me create one. That's literally the only reason it exists.

## What Data Do We Collect?

**Nothing.** Zero. Nada. Zilch.

We don't collect, store, use, or even look at your data. We don't know who you are, what you're doing, or what you had for breakfast.

## What Do We Do With Your Data?

Since we don't collect any data, we don't do anything with it. It's pretty simple.

## Third-Party Services

We don't use any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking services. Your data stays with you, where it belongs.

## Children's Privacy

We don't collect data from anyone, including children. Equal opportunity privacy for all ages.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our minds and decide to collect data (which would be surprising), we'll update this policy. But honestly, don't hold your breath.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, feel free to reach out. But the answer will probably just be: "We still don't collect your data."

**Last Updated:** December 2025

**Summary:** We don't collect, use, store, or share any of your personal information. This policy exists solely because Google requires one for app distribution.
