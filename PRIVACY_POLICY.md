# Privacy Policy

## TL;DR: I Don't Touch Your Data

This privacy policy exists because Google made me make one. That's literally the only reason it exists.

## What Data Do I Collect?

**Nothing.** Zero. Nada. Zilch.

I do not collect, use, or even look at your data. I don't know who you are, what you're doing, or what you had for breakfast.

## What Do I Do With Your Data?

Nothing.
Your Data is for you not me.

## Changes to This Policy

If I ever change my mind and decide to collect data (a time that will never be reached), I'll update this policy.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, feel free to reach out. But the answer will probably just be: "I Dont want ur data."
