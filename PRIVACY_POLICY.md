# Privacy Policy

Look, this policy only exists because Google made me write one. Otherwise, you wouldn't be reading this right now. 

## What Data Do I Want?

I don't want your data. 

Seriously.  I don't collect anything, don't track anything, don't even know who you are, where you are, who your family is, or any of that stuff.  Zero. Nada. Not a single byte.

## Why Would I Want Your Data?

I wouldn't want it. There is no reason why I should know your name, email address, country, town, device, or age lol. 

## What Do I Do With Your Data? 

Nothing.  It's yours, keep it. I don't want it.  Don't try to give it to me or that email's getting deleted. 

## Will This Ever Change?

No. It won't.  Ever. 

## Got Questions? 

Feel free to reach out if you want, but the answer's going to be the same: "I really don't want your data."
